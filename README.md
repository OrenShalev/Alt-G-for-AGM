# Alt-G-for-AGM

> Chrome extension for navigating to a defect/user story/etc. by its ID.

Disclaimer: I made this for my personal use. If it doesn't work for you or causing any problem -- tough. :) I'd appreciate feedback and suggestions for improvement, especially as pull requests.

## Installation
1. Navigate to chrome://extensions.
2. Turn on Developer Mode (currently a checkbos at the top-right).
3. Download the .zip file under dist/ ([here](dist/Alt-G-for-AGM.zip?raw=true)).
4. Drag the zip to the extensions page's landing zone.
5. Approve dialogs if necessary and check that the new extension appears and is enabled.
6. On future restarts of Chrome, it will suggest to disable developer extensions; choose "Cancel".

## Usage
1. In any AGM screen, hit alt + G. Make sure you use the left alt, not the right one (alt gr).
2. If you're in the Product Backlog or Release Management screens, ype an ID of a user story, a feature or a theme and confirm.
3. If you're in any other screen, defects management or other, type an ID of a defect and confirm.
